# Web-Scraping-By-Python

<p>Web Scraping is a process of extracting content from a website. Thr broader steps to scrape data froma website are:
<ul>
  <li>Recognize unique HTML site structures</li>
  <li>Extract and transform content</li>
  <li>Store scraped data</li>
  <li>Extract data from APIs</li>
</ul>

In this project, I have scraped data from the website http://books.toscrape.com/, the code to scrape the data can be found in the scraping_books_data Python notebook and the output in CSV format can be found in book_scraped_data file</p>
